BACKGROUND

Cambridge Hydronautics Ltd. is a company established by former members of the
CAUV team to develop a commercial AUV, based in part on intellectual property
developed by themselves and others as part of the CAUV student society.

Undergraduate students at the University of Cambridge generally own
intellectual property that they generate (including things like software
copyright, mechanical and electrical designs), and this continues to be the
case for new contributions to the CAUV student society.

It is advantageous both to CAUV, to each contributing individual, and to
Cambridge Hydronautics that the majority of the software continues to be owned
by a single entity because all of the significant contributions to the software
would not work without each other - they are each completely dependant on other
parts in order to function. Unless each of the authors assigned copyright to a
single entity then the parts of the code that each individual wrote would
remain their property, and each individual would, in theory, be able to prevent
others (including CAUV) from using their work at any future date.

The intent of this license is to create a platform on which new, advanced, and
interested ideas for AUVs and autonomous software can be developed by providing
a stable platform for them to be built on.

In the future we hope that new members of the CAUV team will develop
better and more advanced algorithms, and take advantage of this software
platform that is, and will remain, freely given.

Cambridge Hydronautics may (and has previously) entered into separate
agreements with individual members of the society, which may supersede this
license.

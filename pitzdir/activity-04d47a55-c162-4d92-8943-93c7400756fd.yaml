description: 'pscore changed to 2

  description changed to We have a working graphcut node, which modifies its input
  mask to be a correctly segmented one. What we need now is a node to use this mask
  to segment the image into fore- and background based on the mask. This should be
  a trivial per-pixel masking, unless someone wants to tackle soft segmentation (not
  recommended!)

  tags changed to [<pitz.Tag 8da7e1 image processing>]

  title changed to Write segmentation node

  points changed to None

  milestone changed to Michaelmas Blitz 2010

  estimate changed to trivial'

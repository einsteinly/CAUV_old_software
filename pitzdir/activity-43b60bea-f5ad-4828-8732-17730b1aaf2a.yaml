description: "pscore changed to 4\nattached_files changed to []\ndescription changed\
  \ to Implement a python script that listens for sonar data line messages, records\
  \ them in pickle shelf, and can play them back.\r\n\r\nThe program should be along\
  \ the lines of persist.py, but should support interactive changing of the pickle\
  \ shelf, so that different sections of sonar data can easily be saved to different\
  \ files without restarting the program.\r\n\r\nThe playback rate should either be\
  \ determined from the rate the data was received (by timestamping on receive), or\
  \ maybe set by hand.\r\n\r\nEven better if the program can switch between recording\
  \ and playing back without a restart.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to collect data\
  \ to test wall-tracking.\r\n\r\n\ntitle changed to SonarDataLine Logger\ntags changed\
  \ to [<pitz.Tag 946c0c testing>, <pitz.Tag dc1893 messaging>, <pitz.Tag f0ce25 logging>,\
  \ <pitz.Tag f9c421 sonar>]\npoints changed to None\nmilestone changed to Summer\

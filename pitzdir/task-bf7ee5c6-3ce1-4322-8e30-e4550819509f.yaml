description: "The output file name is re-calculated for each new invalid frame: this\
  \ means\nthat for names with timestamps in a large number of files are created (probably\n\
  with significant overheard)\n\nIf a frame in the video is invalid data (e.g. wrong\
  \ number of channels, or \n0x0 size), then the previous filename should still be\
  \ retained.\n\nNote however that once a file has had valid data written to it, we\
  \ don't want\nit to ever be overwritten on disk."

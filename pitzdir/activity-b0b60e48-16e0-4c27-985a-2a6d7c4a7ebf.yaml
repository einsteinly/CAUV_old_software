  \ to Running scripts that reside on the AUV from the GUI is difficult: remote.py\
  \ exists to run snippets of python code in a standard execution context (auv variables,\
  \ etc), but loading external files using this method is quite tricky.\r\n\r\nWe\
  \ require something that can take a name of something to run, and look in a library\
  \ of scripts (which are probably all going to share some sort of interface), pick\
  \ the right one, run it, and return the result.\ntitle changed to Script Library\n\

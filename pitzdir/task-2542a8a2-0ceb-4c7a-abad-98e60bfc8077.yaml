description: !!python/unicode "Currently remote.py teats each script it receives to\
  \ execute as independent, and it resets the environment before executing each script.\
  \ It would probably be more useful if it could present an ipython shell. \r\n\r\n\
  This could either replace the current remote script execution mechanism, or supplement\
  \ it. The GUI would support this very easily (and doesn't support the current method\
  \ very well).\r\n"

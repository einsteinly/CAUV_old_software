  \ to We need a high-throughput, low-latency message bus (to replace Spread which\
  \ is\r\ntoo slow) it must:  \r\n - not copy data that need not be copied (ie messages\
  \ between programs on the\r\n   same host should not involve data being copied)\r\
  \n - not serialise / deserialise data between programs with the same data\r\n  \
  \ representations on the same host (ie, use shared memory)\r\n - provide at least\
  \ the following data types to be used with any Plain Old Data\r\n   Structs:\r\n\
  \    - vector\r\n    - map\r\n - prove a simple interface; preferably native c++\r\
  \n - be easy to setup across a local network (preferably with no configuration\r\
  \n   required and some sort of automatic discovery)\r\n - enable large message sequences\
  \ to be replayed either centrally\r\n   or by a client program in a way that is\
  \ indistinguishable to other\r\n   clients and preferably rovides intelligent verification\
  \ of messages\r\n   against those expected.\r\n - be completely unaware of data\
  \ types: we don't want to have to\r\n   recompile it if the message specification\
  \ changes.\r\n   This is highly non-trivial and considerable thought and actual\r\
  \n   ''design'' will be necessary to get it right.\npoints changed to None\nmilestone\

description: "pscore changed to 2\nstatus changed to finished\ndescription changed\
  \ to When an OpenCV capture (eg from a webcam, or probably a file/video too) is\
  \ closed, the memory associated with the image (cv::Mat) from it is immediately\
  \ freed --- even if cv::Mats still exist that are referencing that memory.\r\n\r\
  \nThis can cause invalid accesses if capture nodes are removed whist image processing\
  \ is happening, workarounds include adding a copy node, and disconnecting the node,\
  \ (then waiting for children to finish executing), before deleting it.\r\n\r\nA\
  \ proper fix may be non-trivial. Can we pass our own memory to cv::capture stuff\
  \ and control when it's freed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ntitle changed to Fix possible memory\
  \ corruption when capture nodes are removed.\ntags changed to [<pitz.Tag 8da7e1\
  \ image processing>]\ncreated_by changed to James Crosby\npoints changed to None\n\
  owner changed to James Crosby\nestimate changed to small project"

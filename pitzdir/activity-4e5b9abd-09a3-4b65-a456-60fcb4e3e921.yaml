description: 'status changed to finished

  description changed to We should expose the temperature information provided by
  the motherboard, and forward is as messages every few seconds, or so, or when it
  temperature(s) change significantly.  This is more of a linux system problem than
  a programming problem, it might be quite a good task for someone who has some familiarity
  with linux, but not with our messaging system.  On the other hand, trying to get
  the temperature information might turn out to be ridiculously complicated... but
  it probably won''t be.

  points changed to None

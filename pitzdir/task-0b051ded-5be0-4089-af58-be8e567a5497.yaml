description: "We need a high-throughput, low-latency message bus (to replace Spread\
  \ which is\ntoo slow) it must:  \n - not copy data that need not be copied (ie messages\
  \ between programs on the\n   same host should not involve data being copied)\n\
  \ - not serialise / deserialise data between programs with the same data\n   representations\
  \ on the same host (ie, use shared memory)\n - provide at least the following data\
  \ types to be used with any Plain Old Data\n   Structs:\n    - vector\n    - map\n\
  \ - prove a simple interface; preferably native c++\n - be easy to setup across\
  \ a local network (preferably with no configuration\n   required and some sort of\
  \ automatic discovery)\n - enable large message sequences to be replayed either\
  \ centrally\n   or by a client program in a way that is indistinguishable to other\n\
  \   clients and preferably rovides intelligent verification of messages\n   against\
  \ those expected.\n - be completely unaware of data types: we don't want to have\
  \ to\n   recompile it if the message specification changes.\n   This is highly non-trivial\
  \ and considerable thought and actual\n   ''design'' will be necessary to get it\
  \ right."

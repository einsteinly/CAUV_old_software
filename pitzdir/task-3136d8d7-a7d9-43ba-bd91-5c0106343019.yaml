description: 'Pipeline manipulation MUST be absolutely robust, all possible operations
  should

  be tested, lots, with and without the pipeline running, and with various

  set-ups.

  We also need tests that are reasonably good at exposing concurrency issues --

  this probably means artificially reducing the resources of one of more

  processes in a varying way as tests are repeated.'

description: 'The sonar takes several seconds to acquire a full image, in which time
  the

  vehicle can move considerably, distorting the image.


  When composing sonar images, it should be possible to reduce the distortion by

  taking account, in particular, of vehicle rotation. Movement compensation would

  also be ideal.


  This probably belongs in the library that is currently used to compose sonar

  data into radial images.'

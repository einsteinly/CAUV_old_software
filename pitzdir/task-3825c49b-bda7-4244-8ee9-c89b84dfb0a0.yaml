description: !!python/unicode 'The sonar takes several seconds to acquire a full image,
  in which time the vehicle can move considerably, distorting the image.  When composing
  sonar images, it should be possible to reduce the distortion by taking account,
  in particular, of vehicle rotation. Movement compensation would also be ideal.  This
  probably belongs in the library that is currently used to compose sonar data into
  radial images.'

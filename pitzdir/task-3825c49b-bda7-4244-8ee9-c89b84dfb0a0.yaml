description: !!python/unicode "The sonar takes several seconds to acquire a full image,\
  \ in which time the\r\nvehicle can move considerably, distorting the image.\r\n\r\
  \nWhen composing sonar images, it should be possible to reduce the distortion by\r\
  \ntaking account, in particular, of vehicle rotation. Movement compensation would\r\
  \nalso be ideal.\r\n\r\nThis probably belongs in the library that is currently used\
  \ to compose sonar\r\ndata into radial images."

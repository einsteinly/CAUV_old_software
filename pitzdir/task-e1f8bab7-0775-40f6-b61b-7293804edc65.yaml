description: 'The electronics team would like a simple push-button GUI to drive motors
  so

  that they can test without someone typing things into python.


  The simplest way to do this might be with a simple app running on the sub,

  accessed via vnc, or alternatively the client needs to be able to run on

  whatever sort of laptop the elctronics team are going to use for this, and to

  work with zero configuration (or, at least one-time saved configuration).'

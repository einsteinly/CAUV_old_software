description: !!python/unicode "Running scripts that reside on the AUV from the GUI\
  \ is difficult: remote.py exists to run snippets of python code in a standard execution\
  \ context (auv variables, etc), but loading external files using this method is\
  \ quite tricky.\r\n\r\nWe require something that can take a name of something to\
  \ run, and look in a library of scripts (which are probably all going to share some\
  \ sort of interface), pick the right one, run it, and return the result."

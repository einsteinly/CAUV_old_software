  \ library organiation changes in OpenCV 2.2, but also the\r\nintroduction of lots\
  \ of new shiny things (like gpu-scceleration) that we're\r\ngoing to want to use.\r\
  \n\r\nThis will require some changes to our CMake find-opencv script: this script\r\
  \n(or, rather, a better replacement for it) may even be included in CMake now.\r\
  \n\r\nSome source code changes are also likely to be necessary.\r\n\r\nSee http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/OpenCV%20Change%20Logs\
  \ for changelogs.\r\nIn particular we should be using CV_RGB2HSV_FULL for colour\
  \ conversion.\npoints changed to None\nowner changed to Leszek Swirski"

description: !!python/unicode "Implement a python script that listens for sonar data\
  \ line messages, records them in pickle shelf, and can play them back.\r\n\r\nThe\
  \ program should be along the lines of persist.py, but should support interactive\
  \ changing of the pickle shelf, so that different sections of sonar data can easily\
  \ be saved to different files without restarting the program.\r\n\r\nThe playback\
  \ rate should either be determined from the rate the data was received (by timestamping\
  \ on receive), or maybe set by hand.\r\n\r\nEven better if the program can switch\
  \ between recording and playing back without a restart.\r\n\r\nThis would allow\
  \ us to collect data to test wall-tracking.\r\n\r\n"

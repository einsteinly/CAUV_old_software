description: "This will form one or more nodes for the image processing pipeline:\
  \ see\nauv/pipeline/nodes/, along with appropriate messages.\n\nRequirements:\n\
  \ - Identify when there is an object present in the field of view of the camera.\n\
  \ - Communicate the presence of the object, and its location in the field of view\n\
  \   using messages.\n\nThis is mostly a segmentation problem: with some intelligence\
  \ to know when the\nsegmented area is significant."

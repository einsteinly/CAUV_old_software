description: !!python/unicode "It is possible to point the sonar in one direction,\
  \ and ping continuously,\r\nreturning a 1D line image.\r\n\r\nWe can use this to\
  \ measure the distance to, for example, a wall, as we track\r\nalong it.\r\n\r\n\
  To do this we require:\r\n - a way of controlling the sonar mode from the message\
  \ bus\r\n - Relatively simple 1D image processing to either compare successive images\r\
  \n   and determine aggregate movement, or to find the most significant edge in\r\
  \n   the image, and then send a message containing that information.\r\n\r\nThe\
  \ former probably belongs in the sonar program, the latter as a node in the\r\n\
  image processing pipeline, or possibly as another standalone program."

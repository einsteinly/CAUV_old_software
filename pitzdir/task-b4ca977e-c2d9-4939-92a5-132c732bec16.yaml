description: "It is possible to point the sonar in one direction, and ping continuously,\n\
  returning a 1D line image.\n\nWe can use this to measure the distance to, for example,\
  \ a wall, as we track\nalong it.\n\nTo do this we require:\n - a way of controlling\
  \ the sonar mode from the message bus\n - Relatively simple 1D image processing\
  \ to either compare successive images\n   and determine aggregate movement, or to\
  \ find the most significant edge in\n   the image, and then send a message containing\
  \ that information.\n\nThe former probably belongs in the sonar program, the latter\
  \ as a node in the\nimage processing pipeline, or possibly as another standalone\
  \ program."

description: "pscore changed to 3\ndescription changed to We want to run more than\
  \ one instance of the image processing program.\r\n\r\nThis is not possible, since\
  \ messages to control the pipeline are not filtered per-program, so multiple instances\
  \ cannot be individually controlled.\r\n\r\nA simple fix is to add an ID field to\
  \ only those messages that require it, and have pipelines generate and broadcast\
  \ a unique ID when they start (or when requested to), which the pipeline GUI can\
  \ listen to, and then offer to the user as a choice of which pipeline to control.\n\
  title changed to Extend messaging to discriminate between multiple instances of\
  \ the same program\ntags changed to [<pitz.Tag cf2b7e gui>, <pitz.Tag dc1893 messaging>,\
  \ <pitz.Tag 8da7e1 image processing>]\npoints changed to None\nestimate changed\

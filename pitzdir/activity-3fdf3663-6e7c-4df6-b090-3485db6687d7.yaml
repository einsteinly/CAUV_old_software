description: "pscore changed to 3\ndescription changed to \r\nAt the moment we rely\
  \ on CMake to stop spurious re-generation of messages, but the way that we generate\
  \ more than one file for each target means that if only one of them changes then\
  \ all in the target are regenerated --- and so code that depends on them is recompiled.\r\
  \n\r\nUsing finer-grained CMake targets for generated files might be another option.\r\

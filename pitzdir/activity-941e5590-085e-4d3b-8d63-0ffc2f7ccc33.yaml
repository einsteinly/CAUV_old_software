  \ to Set ourselves some sensible proper coding standards, this is especially important\
  \ for python, where mistakes are often not noticed until it's too late:\r\n\r\n\
  * pylint on everything, don't just use -E\r\n* set ourselves a proper pylint configuration:\
  \ with things like license comments on third party library includes, if we can do\
  \ this, and things that are useful to us. This is a serious amount of work: we want\
  \ a high signal to noise ratio from pylint.\r\n\r\nalso, pylint picks up the installed\
  \ cauv python module fine, but we should probably add the non-installed directory\
  \ to it's search path\r\n\r\n\ntitle changed to Pylint improvements\ntags changed\

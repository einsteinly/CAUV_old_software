description: !!python/unicode 'We should expose the temperature information provided
  by the motherboard, and forward is as messages every few seconds, or so, or when
  it temperature(s) change significantly.  This is more of a linux system problem
  than a programming problem, it might be quite a good task for someone who has some
  familiarity with linux, but not with our messaging system.  On the other hand, trying
  to get the temperature information might turn out to be ridiculously complicated...
  but it probably won''t be.'

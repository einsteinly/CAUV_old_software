description: 'We should expose the temperature information provided by the motherboard,
  and

  forward is as messages every few seconds, or so, or when it temperature(s)

  change significantly.


  This is more of a linux system problem than a programming problem, it might be

  quite a good task for someone who has some familiarity with linux, but not with

  our messaging system.


  On the other hand, trying to get the temperature information might turn out to

  be ridiculously complicated... but it probably won''t be.'

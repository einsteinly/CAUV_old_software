description: "This will form one or more nodes for the image processing pipeline (see\n\
  auv/pipeline/nodes/), along with appropriate messages.\n\nRequirements:\n - Recognise\
  \ known shapes in both camera and sonar images.\n - Match known 2D targets in any\
  \ position/orientation.\n - Be easily trainable with new targets.\n\nObjects already\
  \ segmented by object detection should probably be used as input.\nFor camera images,\
  \ a relatively high update rate will be available, it may be\nuseful to use this\
  \ time-sequence cdata to improve reliability."

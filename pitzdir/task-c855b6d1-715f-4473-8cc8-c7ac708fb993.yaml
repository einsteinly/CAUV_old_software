description: 'The AUV needs to be able to search for things in it''s environment,
  this

  requires some kind of search-pattern movement to cover an area, whilst avoiding

  obstacles (see separate task).


  This should be implemented in python, the main difficulties will be

  integrating with other scripts (don''t want to search whilst doing something

  else!) and the obstacle avoidance problem.'

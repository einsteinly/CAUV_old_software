description: "pscore changed to 3\nattached_files changed to []\ndescription changed\
  \ to Currently remote.py teats each script it receives to execute as independent,\
  \ and it resets the environment that it executes them. It would probably be more\
  \ useful if it could present an ipython shell. \r\n\r\nThis could either replace\
  \ the current remote script execution mechanism, or supplement it. The GUI would\
  \ support this very easily (and doesn't support the current method very well).\r\
  \n\ntitle changed to Improve remote.py: present a proper remote shell (preferably\
  \ ipython)\npoints changed to None\nmilestone changed to Summer Term 2011\nestimate\

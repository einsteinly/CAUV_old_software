description: "pscore changed to 0\nattached_files changed to []\ndescription changed\
  \ to It is possible to point the sonar in one direction, and ping continuously,\r\
  \nreturning a 1D line image.\r\n\r\nWe can use this to measure the distance to,\
  \ for example, a wall, as we track\r\nalong it.\r\n\r\nTo do this we require:\r\n\
  \ - a way of controlling the sonar mode from the message bus\r\n - Relatively simple\
  \ 1D image processing to either compare successive images\r\n   and determine aggregate\
  \ movement, or to find the most significant edge in\r\n   the image, and then send\
  \ a message containing that information.\r\n\r\nThe former probably belongs in the\
  \ sonar program, the latter as a node in the\r\nimage processing pipeline, or possibly\
  \ as another standalone program.\ntags changed to [<pitz.Tag 8da7e1 image processing>,\
  \ <pitz.Tag f9c421 sonar>]\npoints changed to None\nmilestone changed to Summer\

description: !!python/unicode "We want to run more than one instance of the image\
  \ processing program.\r\n\r\nThis is not possible, since messages to control the\
  \ pipeline are not filtered per-program, so multiple instances cannot be individually\
  \ controlled.\r\n\r\nA simple fix is to add an ID field to only those messages that\
  \ require it, and have pipelines generate and broadcast a unique ID when they start\
  \ (or when requested to), which the pipeline GUI can listen to, and then offer to\
  \ the user as a choice of which pipeline to control."

description: "pscore changed to 1\ndescription changed to Status of this is that the\
  \ issue is no longer reproducible --- rebuild of opencv in debug mode failed to\
  \ produce the crashes for debugging, then a re-install of a release mode build still\
  \ doesn't cause it.\r\n\r\nI made a small change to cap_v4l.lib to reduce the number\
  \ of valgrind warnings about uninitialised values in syscalls, but all the memcheck\
  \ warnings that occur there appear to be safe to ignore anyway.\r\n\r\nIt's most\
  \ likely that other changes to the pipeline to re-instate immediate opening of captures\
  \ on construction has fixed the issue (maybe something to do with the thread from\
  \ which they are first opened?).\r\n\ntitle changed to Status\ncreated_by changed\
  \ to James Crosby\nentity changed to <pitz.Task 5a3a61 Fix the video4linux/opencv\
  \  camera issues>\nwho_said_it changed to James Crosby"

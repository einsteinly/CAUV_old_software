description: !!python/unicode "Set ourselves some sensible proper coding standards,\
  \ this is especially important for python, where mistakes are often not noticed\
  \ until it's too late:\r\n\r\n* pylint on everything, don't just use -E\r\n* set\
  \ ourselves a proper pylint configuration: with things like license comments on\
  \ third party library includes, if we can do this, and things that are useful to\
  \ us. This is a serious amount of work: we want a high signal to noise ratio from\
  \ pylint.\r\n\r\nalso, pylint picks up the installed cauv python module fine, but\
  \ we should probably add the non-installed directory to it's search path\r\n\r\n"

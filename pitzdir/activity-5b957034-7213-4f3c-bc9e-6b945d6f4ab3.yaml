description: "description changed to Currently remote.py teats each script it receives\
  \ to execute as independent, and it resets the environment before executing each\
  \ script. It would probably be more useful if it could present an ipython shell.\
  \ \r\n\r\nThis could either replace the current remote script execution mechanism,\
  \ or supplement it. The GUI would support this very easily (and doesn't support\
  \ the current method very well).\r\n"

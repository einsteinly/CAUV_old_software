description: !!python/unicode "When an OpenCV capture (eg from a webcam, or probably\
  \ a file/video too) is closed, the memory associated with the image (cv::Mat) from\
  \ it is immediately freed --- even if cv::Mats still exist that are referencing\
  \ that memory.\r\n\r\nThis can cause invalid accesses if capture nodes are removed\
  \ whist image processing is happening, workarounds include adding a copy node, and\
  \ disconnecting the node, (then waiting for children to finish executing), before\
  \ deleting it.\r\n\r\nA proper fix may be non-trivial. Can we pass our own memory\
  \ to cv::capture stuff and control when it's freed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

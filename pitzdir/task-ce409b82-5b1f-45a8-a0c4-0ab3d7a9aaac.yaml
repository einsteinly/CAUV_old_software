description: There are GPU implementations of the SURF feature detection algorithm,
  at <http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/code/gpusurf/> and <http://www.visual-experiments.com/demos/gpusurf/>.
  The former in particular looks interesting, as it uses OpenCV, Boost, and CUDA,
  all three of which we either use or want to use. Someone needs to look into this,
  and see how much effort it would be to integrate it into our image pipeline.

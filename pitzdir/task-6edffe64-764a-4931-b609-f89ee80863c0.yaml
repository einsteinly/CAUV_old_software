description: 'There are significant library organiation changes in OpenCV 2.2, but
  also the

  introduction of lots of new shiny things (like gpu-scceleration) that we''re

  going to want to use.


  This will require some changes to our CMake find-opencv script: this script

  (or, rather, a better replacement for it) may even be included in CMake now.


  Some source code changes are also likely to be necessary.


  See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/OpenCV%20Change%20Logs for changelogs.

  In particular we should be using CV_RGB2HSV_FULL for colour conversion.'

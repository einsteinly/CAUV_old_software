description: 'description changed to The sonar takes several seconds to acquire a
  full image, in which time the vehicle can move considerably, distorting the image.  When
  composing sonar images, it should be possible to reduce the distortion by taking
  account, in particular, of vehicle rotation. Movement compensation would also be
  ideal.  This probably belongs in the library that is currently used to compose sonar
  data into radial images.

description: "pscore changed to 3\ndescription changed to By listening to motor state\
  \ messages, monitoring light state (when controlled), and monitoring the CPU load,\
  \ it should be possible to get an approximate estimate of power consumption and\
  \ battery capacity used/remaining.\r\n\r\nThis will probably consist of a python\
  \ script that listens for the appropriate messages, and every few seconds updates\
  \ a file on disk (for persistency), and broadcasts the current power and charge\
  \ levels.\r\n\r\nThe GUI should also be updated to display the power/charge information.\n\
  tags changed to [<pitz.Tag f0ce25 logging>, <pitz.Tag dc1893 messaging>]\ntitle\
  \ changed to Implement software-based power/battery charge tracking\npoints changed\
  \ to None\nmilestone changed to Lent Blitz 2011\nestimate changed to trivial"

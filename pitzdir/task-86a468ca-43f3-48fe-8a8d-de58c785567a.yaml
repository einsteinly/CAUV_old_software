description: 'For testing, a simulator will come in very useful. We will want to test
  both

  image processing and control loops, and eventually the AI too, without actually

  having to put the damn thing in a swimming pool.


  The control loops can be tested very simply with a random motion input, and the

  image processing can be tested with recorded image data. However, this will not

  allow us to test any AI, as the image data will be predetermined.


  Therefore, this task would be to create a physics simulator, which can also

  render images for the webcams. We wouldn''t start from scratch: most likely, we

  should use Microsoft Robotics, as we already have something for that.'

description: "pscore changed to 2\nattached_files changed to []\ndescription changed\
  \ to The OpenCV camera input isn't great, if we want to broadcast images over the\
  \ network we end up decoding jpeg, then recoding jpeg. It would be better if we\
  \ had access to the raw jpeg data from the webcam.\r\n\r\nThis might be possible\
  \ using video for linux. Handing hot plugging of cameras would also be good.\r\n\
  \r\n\ntitle changed to Higher performace camera input\ntags changed to [<pitz.Tag\
  \ 8da7e1 image processing>]\npoints changed to None\nestimate changed to significant\

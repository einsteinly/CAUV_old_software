description: !!python/unicode "Image processing operations that  use changes in images\
  \ need o know the true frame-rate at any moment in time -- the best way to do this\
  \ is by giving images timestamps when they are captured by cameras.\r\n\r\nThere\
  \ may b some complexity in serialisation/de-serialisation of the timestamps for\

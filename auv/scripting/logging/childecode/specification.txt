# CHIL serialisation format specification

Basic Types:
int8_t :
int16_t: + or - followed by any number of decimal digits
int32_t:

uint8_t :
uint16_t: as intXX_t, though leading - is not allowed
uint32_t:

float :
double: as python floating point number

string: base16 encoded (upper or lower case hex characters are legal), no quotes


Structures:
Comma separated list of fields enclosed in parentheses, e.g.:
(field1,field2,field2)

Variants:
(discriminant,value)
The discriminant is a number corresponding to the 0-based index of the type of
the value field; order is as specified in messages.msg

Vectors:
Comma separated list of items enclosed in parentheses, e.g.: 
(item0,item2,item3,...)

As a special case, a vector of uint8_t is encoded as base16, e.g:
1e5fed6587df3e7645adbaa6bcc8


Maps:
Comma separated list of pairs (colon separated) of items enclosed in parentheses, e.g.:
(key1:value1,key2:value2,key3:value3)

Messages:
As a structure, with a prefixed message ID e.g.:
123(field,field,field,field)
